        <h2>Wildfire Detection and Checking</h2>
        <p>
          Wildfires are getting more destructive over time due to many factors
          including climate change. Besides the devastating impact on lives and
          property, wildfires also release significant amount of carbon back
          into the atmosphere, thus speeding up climate change even further. The
          goal of this project is to automatically detect wildfires in their
          initial phase, so the authorities responsible for wildfires can take
          appropriate action while the fire is still small and easy to manage.
          This project does not have any opinion on determining the optimal
          action for each fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project uses machine learning based tools to identify potential
          smoke from wildfires using real-time images from cameras installed at
          vantage points, such as mountain tops and cell towers. The information
          about the automatically detected potential wildfires is displayed on
          the website in real-time for people to check and confirm whether they
          are real fires. For real fires, people may wish to inform local fire
          department. This system has successfully detected some fires before
          authorities were aware of them, but the system also generates some
          false notificatons. Therefore, it is useful to have people review the
          notificatons. Doing the same task without such a system would require
          a large number of people continuously staring at real-time images
          coming from the same cameras and maintain high vigilence throughout.
          That is the main impediment why these cameras are currently not used
          for detection, but only for verifying reported fires and for
          monitoring known fires.
        </p>
        <p>
          This system continuously monitors a few hundred cameras, some of which
          rotate full 360 degrees every minute or two. The spinning cameras
          usually take a still image when looking at same handful of directions
          every rotation, effectively resulting in a handful of cameras (one per
          direction) for detection purposes. The system has access to the
          cameras installed across California, but currently actively monitors
          only a subset of them (mostly in Southern California) because existing
          users monitor those regions. If you are interested in monitoring a
          different region in California, please contact us at the address
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Folks from multiple organizations have contributed to this project
          during its lifetime - listing some of them here:

        </p>
        <h3 class="w3-padding-16">Wildfire Detection</h3>
        <p>
          The detection technique used by this project relies on three machine
          learning based filters and multiple traditional non-machine-learning
          based algorithms. The three machine learning filters check for whether
          an image contains something that looks like smoke, moves like smoke,
          and whether the current weather conditions are likely to support
          wildifires. Each of these three are briefly described below. Real-time
          images are collected from the cameras and checked by the filters.
          Images that fail any particular filter are discarded immediately,
          while images that are deemed by the filter to be likely fire are then
          checked by the next filter. Only images deemed to likely contain fire
          by all the filters are declared as a potential wildfire by the system.
        </p>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-16">Looks like smoke</h5>
        <p>
          We trained a machine learning model for image object recognitionon
          (Inception V3) to detect if the image contains something that looks
          like smoke. Training requires many thousands of unique images
          containing real smoke as well as roughly equal number of unique images
          that do not contain smoke. The non-smoke images are carefully selected
          to contain things that visually appear similar to smoke so the
          machine-learing model learns to differentiate between them. We
          acquired images of smoke from early phases of historical wildfires
          from these same cameras and cropped them around the fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          For detection, images are divided into slightly overlapping squares of
          299x299 pixels, and the machine learning system computes a value
          (between 0.0 and 1.0) for each square. High values are more likely to
          be real wildfires. The system is not perfect and regularly generates
          false positives, which are mostly triggered by fog or clouds. We are
          continuously working on improving the accuracy of the system. Below
          are sample images of both true and false positives.

        <p>
          This machine learning based filter uses the same image object
          recognitionon model (Inception V3) mentioned above, but this time the
          model was trained on specially prepared composite images that
          highlight changes between successive images (usually one minute apart)
          from the same view. Similar to the earlier model, this one was also
          trained on many thousands of unique composite images containing real
          smoke from early phases of wildfires and images without smoke. Below
          are a few sample composite images of smoke with the changes
          highlighted in red.

        <h5 class="w3-padding-16">Fire weather</h5>
        <p>
          This machine learning based filter uses the weather data (e.g.,
          temperature, humidity, wind, visibility, etc...) at both the camera
          location as well as the location of the potentail fire. It has been
          trained with thousands of datapoints of both real fires and situations
          when false positives were not caught by earlier filters.
        </p>
        <h3 class="w3-padding-16">Wildfire Checking</h3>
        <p>
          The real-time potential wildfire notifications from the detection
          service are displayed on
          <a href="/wildfirecheck/">this live updating site</a>. The display for
          each potential wildfire event is optimized so users can quickly
          determine if the event is real fire or a false positive. Each event
          includes a time-lapse video of previous few minutes of the same area
          as well as a map with a highligheted triangle indicating the view from
          the associated video.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site allows users to vote on each notificaton to indicate whether
          it was a real fire or not. The events where the majority of the users
          confirm a real fire are displayed on a separate
          <a href="/confirmed/">Confirmed Fires</a> tab. The votes are also
          helpful for improving the system by retraining the machine learning
          system with new images. Users can also specify a desired geographical
          region to limit the notifications to those that may overlap the
          specified region.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case someone discovers a real fire that recently ignited, they
          should consider informing the wildfire dispatch center to take
          appropriate action. Please note that this site does not alert the
          authorities directly.

          Open Climate Tech, Inc. is a 501c3 non-profit organization that was
          formally founded in 2020. Although technology alone can't fix all the
          problems made worse by climate change, we believe technology can help
          mitigate some of the adverse effects. The projects supported by this
          organization are developed by volunteers, and we welcome enthusiastic

          collaboration with other groups and encourages volunteers. All code

        <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
        <p>
          These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms
          and conditions of your use of the
          <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://openclimatetech.org"
            >openclimatetech.org</a
          >
          website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and
          services (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding
          between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Website operator
          (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this
          agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent
          that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in
          which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such
          entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with
          the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and
          may not access and use the Website and Services. By accessing and
          using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
          understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You
          acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and the
          Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by
          you, and it governs your use of the Website and Services.
        </p>
        <h2>Accounts and membership</h2>
        <p>
          If you create an account on the Website, you are responsible for
          maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible
          for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions
          taken in connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to,
          monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in and start using
          the Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may
          result in the termination of your account. You must immediately notify
          us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of
          security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,
          including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
          omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any
          part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of
          this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage
          our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the
          foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may
          block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent
          further registration.
        </p>
        <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
        <p>
          Although the Website and Services may link to other resources (such as
          websites, mobile applications, etc.), we are not, directly or
          indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship,
          endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless
          specifically stated herein. Some of the links on the Website may be
          “affiliate links”. This means if you click on the link and purchase an
          item, the Operator will receive an affiliate commission. We are not
          responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the
          offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their
          resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the
          actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties.
          You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions
          of use of any resource which you access through a link on the Website.

        <h2>Intellectual property rights</h2>
        <p>
          “Intellectual Property Rights” means all present and future rights
          conferred by statute, common law or equity in or in relation to any
          copyright and related rights, trademarks, designs, patents,
          inventions, goodwill and the right to sue for passing off, rights to

          in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all
          applications and rights to apply for and be granted, rights to claim
          priority from, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or
          forms of protection and any other results of intellectual activity
          which subsist or will subsist now or in the future in any part of the
          world. This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual
          property owned by the Operator or third parties, and all rights,
          titles, and interests in and to such property will remain (as between
          the parties) solely with the Operator. All trademarks, service marks,
          graphics and logos used in connection with the Website and Services,
          are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Operator or its

          other third parties. Your use of the Website and Services grants you
          no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any of the Operator
          or third party trademarks.

          type of professional advice. Please seek professional assistance

        </p>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will
          the Operator, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
          suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect,
          incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential damages
          (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, revenue,
          sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business
          interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business
          opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including,
          without limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory
          duty, negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party has been
          advised as to the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen
          such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the
          aggregate liability of the Operator and its affiliates, officers,
          employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the services
          will be limited to an amount no greater than one dollar or any amounts

          period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to such
          liability. The limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy
          does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential
          purpose.

        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>
          All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be
          exercised and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent that
          they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited
          to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement
          illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any
          provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or
          unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the
          intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions
          thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject

          shall remain in full force and effect.
